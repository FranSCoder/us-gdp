# US GDP Graph :heavy_dollar_sign:	

## What is this project? :bulb:

A graph app that showcases the GDP of the US in the last 75 years. A D3 tooltip with extra information opens up when the user moves the pointer over each piece of data. It relies on D3.js for tooltip design and data representation.
